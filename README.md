# book-magic

Book Magic is a web application that aggregates book offers from multiple online bookstores into a single platform.

The current version focuses on the backend and is console-based. It includes a Spring Boot backend, a relational database for books and authors, and a scraping service that collects book data from external sources and stores it in the database.

Users can browse books by author slug and view availability information.

The goal is to provide a centralized platform for browsing books, receiving notifications when preferred books become available, tracking availability, and comparing offers.

Technologies: **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **SQL**

Status: In progress – some of core backend functionality implemented, additional features planned.
