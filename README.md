Book Magic is a web application that helps users discover books by automatically collecting and organizing offers from different online bookstores.
It allows users to browse books by author and title, compare availability and prices, and stay informed about new or updated book offers in one place.

Still in progress. So far, the project includes a backend built with Spring Boot, a relational database with books and authors, and a scraping service that fetches book data from external sources and stores it in the database.

The goal is to provide a centralized platform for browsing books, receiving notifications when preferred books become available, tracking availability, and comparing offers.
